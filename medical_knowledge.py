    Sickle Cell Disease (SCD):
    - Inherited blood disorder affecting hemoglobin
    - Causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped
    - Common symptoms: pain crises, anemia, frequent infections
    - Diagnosis through hemoglobin electrophoresis
    - Requires regular medical care and monitoring
    """,
    
    """
    Sickle Cell Trait:
    - Carrier state of sickle cell disease
    - Usually no symptoms
    - One normal and one sickle cell gene
    - Important for family planning
    - Can be detected through screening
    """,
    
    """
    Alpha Thalassemia:
    - Decreased alpha globin chain production
    - Four genes control alpha globin production
    - Severity depends on number of affected genes
    - Common in Mediterranean, Asian, and African populations
    - Can cause mild to severe anemia
    """,
    
    """
    Beta Thalassemia:
    - Reduced or absent beta globin chain production
    - Ranges from mild to severe forms
    - Common symptoms include anemia, bone problems
    - Regular blood transfusions may be needed
    - Genetic counseling important for carriers

    Hemoglobin Test Parameters:
    - RBC (Red Blood Cell Count): Measures number of red blood cells
    - HGB (Hemoglobin): Oxygen-carrying protein level
    - MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume): Average red blood cell size
    - MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): Average hemoglobin per red cell
    - MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration): Concentration of hemoglobin in red cells

    Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:
    - Test to identify abnormal hemoglobin types
    - Measures percentages of different hemoglobin forms
    - Key test for diagnosing hemoglobinopathies
    - Includes HbA, HbA2, HbF, and HbS measurements
    - Essential for accurate diagnosis
    """,

    Treatment Options:
    - Pain management for sickle cell crises
    - Blood transfusions when needed
    - Hydroxyurea therapy for severe cases
    - Bone marrow transplant in selected cases
    - Regular medical monitoring and preventive care

    Prevention and Management:
    - Regular medical check-ups
    - Vaccination against infections
    - Proper hydration and nutrition
