Rare forms ofa and b thalassaemia\nThere are rare forms of\u03b1 thalassaemia with unusual causes. A deletion which removes\nthe \u03b11 gene and extends into the downstream widely expressed gene which is\ntranscribed from the opposite strand. Transcription of this newly apposed gene\nextends back into the\u03b12 gene and silences it (9).

Inherited mutations in this gene produce a syndromal condition\ncharacterised by mental retardation and\u03b1 thalassaemia (11) whereas acquired\nmutations are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes which also have features\nof \u03b1 thalassaemia (12).\nCases with a\u03b2 thalass"}, {"filename": "ery-molecular basis -thalassemias.pdf", "chunk": "ures\nof \u03b1 thalassaemia (12).\nCases with a\u03b2 thalassaemia phenotype unlinked to the\u03b2 globin gene have also been\ndescribed.
